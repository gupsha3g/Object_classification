The 20th Field Robot Event will be organised by the University of Maribor, Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences and will take place in Hoƒçe, Slovenia.

Task 3: sensing and recognizing possible obstacles-

1. Each robot must start the detection after a starting indication (acoustic signal) within 1 min.
The maximum available time for sensing is 5 seconds per obstacle. There can be up to 10 seconds long window to change the pictures by the jury (by first removing the previous picture and placing the new). 

2. Set of images (one after another) will be placed in front of the robot, each of them from one of the three groups: a deer, a human and something else.
